//Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from
//0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one 
//celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that 
//all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she 
//does not know any of them.
//
//Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or 
//verify that there is not one. The only thing you 
//are allowed to do is to ask questions like: 
//"Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of
//whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity
//(or verify there is not one) by asking as few 
//questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
//
//You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) 
//which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a 
//function int findCelebrity(n). There will be 
//exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. 
//Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity
//in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: graph = [
//  [1,1,0],
//  [0,1,0],
//  [1,1,1]
//]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 
//0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows 
//person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i 
//does not know person j. The celebrity is the person
//labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 
//does not know anybody.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: graph = [
//  [1,0,1],
//  [1,1,0],
//  [0,1,1]
//]
//Output: -1
//Explanation: There is no celebrity.
//
//Note:
//The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix,
//which is an n x n matrix where a[i][j] = 1 means person 
//i knows person j while a[i][j] = 0 means the contrary.
//Remember that you won't have direct access to the 
//adjacency matrix.
