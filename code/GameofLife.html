//According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply 
//as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician 
//John Horton Conway in 1970."
//
//Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state 
//live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors 
//(horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules 
//(taken from the above Wikipedia article):
//
//Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused
//by under-population.
//Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next 
//generation.
//Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by 
//over-population..
//Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell,
//as if by reproduction.
//Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the
//board given its current state. The next state is created by applying 
//the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, 
//where births and deaths occur simultaneously.
//
//Example:
//
//Input: 
//[
//  [0,1,0],
//  [0,0,1],
//  [1,1,1],
//  [0,0,0]
//]
//Output: 
//[
//  [0,0,0],
//  [1,0,1],
//  [0,1,1],
//  [0,1,0]
//]
//Follow up:
//Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be
//updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and 
//then use their updated values to update other cells.
//In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. 
//In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems 
//when the active area encroaches the border of the array. 
//How would you address these problems?
