//We are given some website visits: the user with name
//username[i] visited the website website[i] at time 
//timestamp[i].
//
//A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted 
//in ascending order by the time of their visits.  
//(The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)
//
//Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of 
//users. If there is more than one solution, return 
//the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.
//
// 
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: 
//username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], 
//timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 
//website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
//Output: ["home","about","career"]
//Explanation: 
//The tuples in this example are:
//["joe", 1, "home"]
//["joe", 2, "about"]
//["joe", 3, "career"]
//["james", 4, "home"]
//["james", 5, "cart"]
//["james", 6, "maps"]
//["james", 7, "home"]
//["mary", 8, "home"]
//["mary", 9, "about"]
//["mary", 10, "career"]
//The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
//The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
//The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
//The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
//The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
// 
//
//Note:
//3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50
//1 <= username[i].length <= 10
//0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9
//1 <= website[i].length <= 10
//Both username[i] and website[i] contain only lowercase characters.
//It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who 
//visited at least 3 websites. No user visits two websites at the same time.
