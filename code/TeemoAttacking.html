//In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy
//Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time 
//series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you 
//need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.
//
//You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, 
//and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: [1,4], 2
//Output: 4
//Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be
//poisoned immediately. 
//This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
//And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned 
//status for another 2 seconds. 
//So you finally need to output 4.
// 
//Example 2:
//Input: [1,2], 2
//Output: 3
//Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. 
//This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
//However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already 
//in poisoned status. 
//Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack 
//will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. 
//So you finally need to output 3.
// 
//Note:
//You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.
//You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning 
//time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.
