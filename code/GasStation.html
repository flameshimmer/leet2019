//There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
//station i is gas[i].
//You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel
//from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty
//tank at one of the gas stations.
//Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit
//once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
//
//Note:
//If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
//Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
//Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: 
//gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
//cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4
//= 4
//Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
//Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
//Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
//Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
//Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to
//station 3.
//Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: 
//gas  = [2,3,4]
//cost = [3,4,3]
//Output: -1
//Explanation:
//You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the
//next station.
//Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
//Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
//Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
//You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only
//have 3.
//Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
