//Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with 
//Alice starting first.
//
//Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  
//On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
//
//Choosing any x with 0 &lt; x &lt; N and N % x == 0.
//Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
//Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
//
//Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: 2
//Output: true
//Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: 3
//Output: false
//Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
// 
//Note:
//1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000

			Conclusion
			If N is even, can win.
			If N is odd, will lose.

			Recursive Prove （Top-down)
			If N is even.
			We can choose x = 1.
			The opponent will get N - 1, which is a odd.
			Reduce to the case odd and he will lose.

			If N is odd,
			2.1 If N = 1, lose directly.
			2.2 We have to choose an odd x.
			The opponent will get N - x, which is a even.
			Reduce to the case even and he will win.

			So the N will change odd and even alternatively until N = 1.

			Mathematical Induction Prove （Bottom-up)
			N = 1, lose directly
			N = 2, will win choosing x = 1.
			N = 3, must lose choosing x = 1.
			N = 4, will win choosing x = 1.
			....

			For N &lt;= n, we have find that:
			If N is even, can win.
			If N is odd, will lose.

			For the case N = n + 1
			If N is even, we can win choosing x = 1,
			give the opponent an odd number N - 1 = n,
			force him to lose,
			because we have found that all odd N &lt;= n will lose.

			If N is odd, there is no even x that N % x == 0.
			As a result, we give the opponent a even number N - x,
			and the opponent can win,
			because we have found that all even N &lt;= n can win.

			Now we prove that, for all N &lt;= n,
			If N is even, can win.
			If N is odd, will lose.

			Java/C++:

			return N % 2 == 0;
