#include "stdafx.h"
//Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input
//a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For
//each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 
//historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of 
//sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
//
//The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user 
//typed the exactly same sentence before.
//The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first
//is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, 
//you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
//If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
//When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in
//this case, you need to return an empty list.
//Your job is to implement the following functions:
//
//The constructor function:
//
//AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. 
//The input is historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously
//typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. 
//Your system should record these historical data.
//
//Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will 
//provide the next character the user types:
//
//List&lt;String&gt; input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user.
//The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or 
//a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded
//in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have 
//prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.
//
//Example:
//Operation: 
//AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])
//The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:
//"i love you" : 5 times
//"island" : 3 times
//"ironman" : 2 times
//"i love leetcode" : 2 times
//Now, the user begins another search:
//
//Operation: input('i')
//Output: ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"]
//Explanation:
//There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and 
//"i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r'
//has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". 
//Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.
//
//Operation: input(' ')
//Output: ["i love you","i love leetcode"]
//Explanation:
//There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".
//
//Operation: input('a')
//Output: []
//Explanation:
//There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".
//
//Operation: input('#')
//Output: []
//Explanation:
//The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a 
//historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted 
//as a new search.
//
//Note:
//The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and 
//only one blank space will exist between two words.
//The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. 
//The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
//Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test 
//cases even for a character input.
//Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class 
//AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple
//test cases. Please see here for more details.
